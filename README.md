# Fun-With-Sorts
This command line java application prompts the user to enter the name of the type of sort they'd like demonstrated and the integer for the length of the random array to be used for the demonstration. The program creates the random array with integers between 1-100. It then prints each iteration of the array as it applies the given sorting method to the random array.
